# Jenkins CI/CD Pipeline with Docker, SonarQube, AWS ECR & ECS

This project demonstrates a fully automated CI/CD pipeline using **Jenkins**, **Maven**, **SonarQube**, **Docker**, **AWS ECR**, and **ECS**. It uses a Java-based application built with Maven, performs code quality scanning via SonarQube, generates a Docker image, pushes it to Amazon ECR, and triggers an ECS service update for deployment.

---

## âœ… CI/CD Pipeline Stages (as per Jenkinsfile)

1. **Fetch Code**
   - Pulls source code from the GitHub branch (`docker`) of the project.

2. **Build (Maven)**
   - Runs `mvn clean install -DskipTests`
   - Compiles and packages the application.

3. **Unit Testing**
   - Runs `mvn test` for test cases.

4. **Checkstyle**
   - Executes static code analysis using Checkstyle plugin.

5. **SonarQube Analysis**
   - Code is scanned and analyzed in SonarQube.
   - Requires `Quality Gate` to pass before proceeding.

6. **Quality Gate**
   - Pipeline waits for SonarQube to return a 'Passed' result.

7. **Build Docker Image**
   - Docker image is built using a multistage Dockerfile located in `./Docker-files/app/multistage/`.

8. **Push Docker Image to AWS ECR**
   - Image is tagged with Jenkins `$BUILD_NUMBER` and `latest`.
   - Pushed securely to Amazon Elastic Container Registry.

9. **Remove Local Docker Images**
   - Cleans up images from Jenkins agent to save space.

10. **Deploy to ECS**
    - Triggers AWS CLI command to update the ECS service in the specified cluster.
    - Performs blue/green style rollout (`--force-new-deployment`).

## âœ… Outcome

By the end of the pipeline, the latest Docker image of the application is running in ECS. This project demonstrates both DevOps skills and cloud-native deployment approach using containerization and AWS services.
